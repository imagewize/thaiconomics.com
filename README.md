# Thaiconomics

This repository contains the codebase for [Thaiconomics.com](https://thaiconomics.com), a website built using modern WordPress development practices.

## Architecture

Thaiconomics uses the following architecture:

- **[Roots Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/)** - A modern WordPress stack that improves folder structure, security, and development workflows
- **[Roots Trellis](https://roots.io/trellis/)** - WordPress development, staging, and production server provisioning and deployments

## Theme

The site uses **Moiraine**, a custom block theme based on the Ollie framework. As a full-featured block theme, Moiraine includes:

- Custom block patterns and styles
- Native WordPress block editor templates
- Custom index, single post, and page templates
- Responsive styling for all WordPress core blocks, including post loops
- No need for traditional PHP template files (header.php, footer.php, etc.)
- Full compatibility with the WordPress Site Editor

The Moiraine theme leverages the power of WordPress's Full Site Editing (FSE) capabilities, allowing for visual customization of all aspects of the site through the block editor interface.

## Development

To set up a local development environment, follow the documentation for [Roots Bedrock](https://docs.roots.io/bedrock/master/installation/) and [Trellis](https://docs.roots.io/trellis/master/installation/).
